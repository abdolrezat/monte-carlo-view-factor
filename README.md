# monte-carlo-view-factor
Monte Carlo simulation for calculating radiation 'view factors' of coaxial parallel disks. 
This code plots the Monte Carlo results and compares them with the actual (analytical) values, and observes the relationship of errors and radii of each disk!
# *.mlx files... See the results first!
The results for this code has already been put in .mlx files. Figures are also exported as .png files.
# Run the code
Run Simulator_Multi.m in MATLAB! 
# Modify
If a different precision is needed in plots, you may manually change the range of r1 and r2 values.
# contribute
Any contribution in further reducing the error of the monte carlo simulation is appreciated (see the error plot), please don't hesitate to contribute or make suggestions!
